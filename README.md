# Anatomy of a Shiny app

Quarto (revealjs) slides for my talk 'Anatomy of a shiny app' at Shiny in Production conference, Newcastle on October 13th 2023.

`index.html` contains the self-contained slides, also available at https://chrisbrownlie.github.io/anatomy_of_shiny_sip2023.
The `img/` folder contains images and figures used in the presentation, as well as some that aren't.
`custom.scss` contains custom Dracula-like styles for the presentation.

The `shiny/` folder contains a fork of the {shiny} repository, with source files categorised according to how I used them for this talk. The most important of these is the `shiny/r6_classes` folder, which contains both the raw files containing R6 class definitions (in `shiny/r6_classes/raw`), and a separate file for each R6 class definition.
